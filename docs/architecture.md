# System Architecture Guide

This document describes the design patterns, architecture boundaries, and cross-layer call flows of **PlaySphere AI**.

## 🏗️ Layered Architecture Overview

The system is separated into three distinct layers to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and clarity for developers.

    subgraph Frontend Layer [Frontend - next dev frontend]
        A[Next.js App Router App] --> B[Visual Components]
        A --> C[React Context / AuthProvider]
        A --> D[Route Middleware]
    end

    subgraph Shared Layer [Shared Domain Logic]
        E[Domain Types]
        F[Static Constants]
        G[Utility Helpers]
    end

    subgraph Backend Layer [Backend - Services & SDKs]
        H[API Routes / Wrapper Handlers] --> I[AI Services - Hosted LLM API]
        H --> J[Firebase Services - Firestore & Auth]
    end

### 1. Frontend Layer
* **App Router (`frontend/src/app`)**: Decides the routing, layout, and page components. Pages act as entrypoints that mount client-side templates and connect state events to actions.
* **Visual Components (`frontend/src/components`)**: Reusable widgets (cards, maps, dashboards) styled using Tailwind CSS and CSS variables.
* **Contexts (`frontend/src/contexts`)**: Handles global React state. For example, `AuthProvider` uses the client-side Firebase SDK to listen to auth state changes and expose the logged-in user profile.

### 2. Backend Layer
* **API Handlers (`frontend/src/app/api`)**: Acts as proxy layers. They intercept HTTP requests, validate request bodies, and delegate the business logic to the backend services.
* **AI Services (`backend/ai`)**: Performs prompting, prompt engineering, and talks to the OpenAI-compatible hosted LLM API.
* **Firebase Services (`backend/firebase`)**: Directly queries Firestore and performs authentication logic.

### 3. Shared Layer
* Includes shared configurations, helper methods, pricing models, and Typescript types. No layer has exclusive ownership; frontend page routing, visual components, API endpoints, and Firestore collections all import from `shared/`.

## 🔄 Core Call Flow Sequence (Example: Booking a Slot)

This diagram shows how a user action on the frontend traverses through the layers to complete a booking in Firestore:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User as User UI
    participant Page as Venue Page (Frontend)
    participant API as /api/bookings (Route)
    participant FS as Firestore Service (Backend)
    participant DB as Firestore Database

    User->>Page: Click "Book Slot"
    Page->>Page: Run Client-side availability check
    Page->>API: HTTP POST /api/bookings { venueId, slot, date }
    API->>FS: invoke createBooking(venueId, userId, slot)
    FS->>DB: Write document to 'bookings' collection
    DB-->>FS: Return Document Reference
    FS-->>API: Return success / ticket ID
    API-->>Page: HTTP 200 OK { ticket }
    Page-->>User: Display Booking Success Modal & Ticket
```

## 🎨 Theme & Styling System
We use a **Neo-Brutalist design language** featuring:
1. **Bold Borders**: Consistent 3px solid black (`border-3 border-black`) borders.
2. **High-Contrast Shadows**: Hard, non-blurry shadows using `box-shadow` (e.g. `box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px #000000;`).
3. **Stark Colors**: Neon yellows (`#facc15`), cyans (`#22d3ee`), and pinks (`#f472b6`) offset by deep space darks (`#080a10`).
4. **Interactive Offsets**: Interactive elements translate slightly on hover and press (e.g. `translate(-2px, -2px)`) while altering shadow weights to give a tactile feel.
